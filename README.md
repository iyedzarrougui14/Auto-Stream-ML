# Auto-Stream-ML

Auto-Stream-ML is a Python application designed to simplify the process of building and automating Machine Learning (ML) pipelines using **Streamlit** and **Pandas Profiling**. The goal of the app is to provide an easy-to-use interface for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Upload datasets in CSV, Excel, or other common formats.
- **Data Exploration**: Automatically generate summary statistics and visualizations using **Pandas Profiling**.
- **Model Training**: Select and train machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- **Automated Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Prediction**: Input new data and make predictions using the trained model.
- **Interactive UI**: The app uses **Streamlit** to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface for the entire ML pipeline.
